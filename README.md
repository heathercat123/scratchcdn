Hey, look, it's /scratchr2/static!

**NOTE**: Not every file is present as no official directory listing is available. As a direct result, every file and directory was found by examining the website's frontend code, examining Issues and Commits from Scratch's open source projects, examining the offline editor, examining the [Scratch 2.0 website development visualization](https://vimeo.com/40179487), sniffing the Scratch 2 Offline Editor, guesswork, and [whatever this  guy used](https://code.chipmunk.land/chipmunkmc/scratchr2-static) (thanks!). As such, many files are missing, but more than the essential is present.
